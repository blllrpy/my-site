          <h1>Sumo robot:</h1>
          <p>
            the robot was controlled by an arduino mega and it had two motors
            with attached gearboxes and it had a sort of double layer design
            with a base piece and a top piece for added rigidity. the front was
            made of a bent piece of thin plastic connected to the top and bottom
            pieces with a hole cut out for an ultrasonic sensor
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>USB solar charger:</h1>
          <p>
            the charger consisted of three solar panels that folded out from the
            base using some servos it also had an internal battery and usb cable
            to charge your elevtronics the servos were also controlled by an
            arduino uno
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>Grabber robot:</h1>
          <p>
            the robot was made with an acryllic base from a robot kit and it had
            two motors to drive it. the arm had three servos to move it and the
            physical assembly was made from some legos that i attached to the
            servo horns with some wire it also hat a bluetooth module so that it
            could connect to your phone as a controller it had a little grabber
            that you could open and close though i admit there was one bug i
            couldnt figure out where the robot would stop working if you made
            the grabber too tight on the object you where grabbing
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>line follower:</h1>
          <p>
            the robot was just a basic line following robot with two color
            sensors two motors a battery and an arduino uno not much to say here

        </li>

          <p>
            it was a ticketing system made with python it was not that
            impressive as i couldnt figure out how to give it a ui and it was
            full of bugs also
